# Coastal Change Detection Using Remote Sensing and Deep Learning

## Abstract
This project leverages remote sensing data, particularly from Sentinel-2 and Landsat satellites, combined with deep learning techniques to identify and monitor coastlines. Our current focus is on the North and Baltic Seas, with goals to detect changes over the past 40 years and predict changes for the next 100 years. Key areas of our current work include active learning, pre-labelling, and developing a labelling tool for remote sensing data.

Here we see the German island of Sylt. On the left, we observe the southern part of the island. The dashed blue line represents the coastline as it was in 1984. Over the past 37 years, approximately 1 km of this coastline has disappeared. Conversely, in the northern part of the island, the coastline has even expanded in certain areas during the same period. While some of these changes are due to human activity—such as relocating sand to maintain tourist beaches—non-anthropogenic factors also play a significant role in coastal changes. Our goal is to identify these changes on a larger scale, understand both human and natural causes, and predict future developments.
